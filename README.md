# Genetic Algorithm

[Genetic algorithms](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/genetic_algorithms/genetic_algorithms_introduction.htm) are randomized search algorithms that have been developed in an effort to imitate the mechanics of natural selection and natural genetics.

This program using a Genetic Algorithm to find the minmum number of coins from a dollar amount inputed by the user

    To Run: GA.py <dollar amount> <population Size>

 
> Note: I converted the dollar amount into a whole number for simplicity.
Example: Quarter = 0.25 but in my program a quarter is 25
