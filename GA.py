    This program using a Genetic Algorithm to find the minmum number of coins
    from a dollar amount inputed by the user

    To Run: GA.py <dollar amount> <population Size>

    Note: I converted the dollar amount into a whole number for simplicity.
    Example: Quarter = 0.25 but in my program a quarter is 25
